# Vehicle-Car-and-Motorcycle-Understanding-Abstract-Classes-and-Inheritance
This Python project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to abstract classes and inheritance. It demonstrates how abstract methods can be defined in a base class (Vehicle) and implemented in its derived classes (Car and Motorcycle). By running the code, users can observe how different types of vehicles share common behaviors defined by the abstract class.

Features:

    Explore abstract classes and abstract methods in Python.
    See practical examples with Vehicle, Car, and Motorcycle classes.
    Understand how inheritance allows different types of vehicles to share common functionality.
